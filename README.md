# **Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning**

Cervical cancer, a significant health concern for women globally, can be tackled through early detection aided by machine learning. Lack of awareness and access to healthcare resources in some regions exacerbates the problem. Machine learning enhances analysis of medical data, facilitating better patient care and satisfaction.

**Problem Statement: 1. Develop machine learning models for accurate cervical cancer diagnosis, aiding doctors in early detection.**

**Problem Statement: 2. Investigate correlations among cervical cancer parameters and conduct a survey to enhance awareness and understanding in the community.:**

### Dataset Information

The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. Several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns (missing values).
| Characteristic       | Description          |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Multivariate         | Yes                  |
| Subject Area         | Health and Medicine  |
| Associated Tasks     | Classification       |
| Feature Type         | Integer, Real        |
| Number of Instances  | 858                  |
| Number of Features   | 36                   |


### Source
The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
- [Cervical Cancer Risk Factors Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29)



### Usage
Researchers and practitioners can use this dataset for various classification tasks related to cervical cancer risk factors. It can be used to develop predictive models and gain insights into the factors associated with cervical cancer.

### Files
The dataset files are available in various formats (e.g., CSV, ARFF) within the data folder of the dataset repository.


### Feature engineering

- Replace'?' with NaN and impute the filling the missing values with mean()
- Dropping Unnecassary feature for ML
- Resampling the Dependent Variable
